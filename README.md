# Pick-A-Joke

I created this just to have a fun homepage/new tab page using Google Chrome's *[New Tab Redirect]*(https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna) extension.<br>
<br>
The page pulls from two different sources, one for the joke and one for the background. The joke is pulled from [this joke API](https://v2.jokeapi.dev/). It's a fun tool that I stumbled upon that is also customizable in terms of what types of jokes you want returned.<br>
<br>
The second source is [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/), which is used for the background image. This tool is fun because you can specify a width and height and it will find you a random image of the desired size.<br>
<br>
If you want to use this with your own *New Tab Redirect*, use [https://joshcanton6.github.io/pick-a-joke](https://joshcanton6.github.io/pick-a-joke) as the target redirect. Hope you enjoy and can have a good laugh!
